## HELLO WORLD ##

I was intrigued by computers since early age. I was at grade 5 when I first played word tetris in school computers, and got hooked up with games. 

I am learning to code in C# language. As a web developer, my knowledge with Javascript, CSS and HTML really helped me work in great companies, that just needed someone to handle their frontend properly. It was rewarding experience, as transitioning from non-technical works like consultant, volunteer, intern, and even office level positions in non-profit and profit companies. Almost all of them required reaching out to people to manage their userbase, which in turn helped them grow. So I also love public speaking in order to empower others. 

I loved github because it was one of my learning resources, and helped me show a portfolio which helped me learn faster! I did my best to learn cyber-security and networking for CISCO but never attended the examination. Because I found programming even more interesting. 

My personal projects are currently in unity, ios swift, andoroid studio kotlin ! 

Keep hacking !
